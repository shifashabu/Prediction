## **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis and predictive modeling using Amazon sales data. The objective is to **predict the TotalAmount of orders** based on features such as Quantity, UnitPrice, and Discount.

**Key Steps:**
1. Load and explore the cleaned dataset (`Amazon_clean.csv`)
2. Visualize feature correlations using a heatmap
3. Determine feature importance using linear regression coefficients
4. Split data into training and test sets
5. Build and train a Linear Regression model
6. Evaluate model performance (R² score, RMSE)
7. Visualize predicted vs actual TotalAmount

## **Key Insights**
- Correlation heatmap helps identify relationships between features and TotalAmount.
- Feature importance plot shows which factors most influence TotalAmount.
- The model achieved an R² of `0.XX` and RMSE of `XXX.XX` (update based on your results).
- Scatter plot shows predicted vs actual values to visually assess model accuracy.
